I created this OpenShift Blue Green Deployment Lab for our Red Hat Partner Training on Oct 27.  It' suppose to be a short 10 minute lab just so the partners can check out the integration with OpenShift and Jenkins.  This feature is Tech Preview.  The lab was based off a project from one of Red Hat colleagues.  The link for the training is below.
